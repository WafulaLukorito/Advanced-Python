# Logging in Python
# Last Updated: 08-02-2018
# Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. Logging is important for software developing, debugging and running. If you donâ€™t have any logging record and your program crashes, there are very little chances that you detect the cause of the problem. And if you detect the cause, it will consume a lot of time. With logging, you can leave a trail of breadcrumbs so that if something goes wrong, we can determine the cause of the problem.
# There are a number of situations like if you are expecting an integer, you have been given a float and you call a cloud API, the service is down for maintenance and much more. Such problems are out of control and are hard to determine.

# Why Printing is not a good option?

# Some developers use the concept of printing the statements to validate if the statements are executed correctly or some error has occurred. But printing is not a good idea. It may solve your issues for simple scripts but for complex scripts, printing approach will fail.

# Python has a built-in module logging which allows writing status messages to a file or any other output streams. The file can contain the information on which part of the code is executed and what problems have been arisen.

# Levels of Log Message



# There are two built-in levels of the log message.

# Debug : These are used to give Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
# Info : These are used to Confirm that things are working as expected
# Warning : These are used an indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future
# Error : This tells that due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function
# Critical : This tells serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running
# If required, developers have the option to create more levels but these are sufficient enough to handle every possible situation. Each built-in level has been assigned its numeric value.
