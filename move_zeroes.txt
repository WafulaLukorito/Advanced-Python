#*Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

#!Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

nums = [0,2,3,0,7,5,0,9,0]

n = len (nums)

j = 0

for num in nums:
    if (num!=0):
        num[j]= num
        j+=1

for i in range (j, n):
    nums[i] = 0

print (nums)
